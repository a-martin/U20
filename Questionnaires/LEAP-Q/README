LEAPQ2007.py is a python implementation of the LEAP-Q questionnaire.

It requires psychopy in order to run.

It is designed to be able to be run in any language.
In order to add a language, simply add a folder in LEAP_text
with a three-letter code for that language.  Remember to
add the language to the list in the python script.

Simple response questions have no special syntax and should
just take up one line.

Dropdown multiple choice questions have the following syntax:

!X;QUESTION;POSSIBLE ANSWER 1;POSSIBLE ANSWER2...

Questions that require participants to respond in a list (e.g.,
please list all the languages you speak) have the following
syntax:

!L;N;PROMPT

Where N is the maximum length of the response list (e.g., 5).
